# OpenSeriousTemplate V3: Complete Framework for Making Serious Games Transmissible

## The Problem to Solve

*"I spent hours creating my workshop, but it's dying on a shelf"*

You've invested significant time ‚åõ and effort üò´ creating a workshop, live serious game, or educational gamification experience üé≤. Ideally, if you want your creation to be transmitted and live on, anyone should be able to pick it up, organize it, play it, facilitate it, ensuring proper usage and even adaptations.

When we publish a live serious game today, we typically include the game rules üìú, but is that really enough for others to master it? To promote it? To ensure it's used properly? What else should we include? ü§î

## The Solution: OpenSeriousTemplate V3

To address all these questions, **#OpenSeriousTemplate** is a model, like a checklist, designed to help creators make their productions more easily transmissible. üöÄ

By using #OpenSeriousTemplate to make your content **self-sustaining and transmissible** ‚ú®, you dramatically increase the chances that anyone can promote, organize, play, facilitate, and adapt your game.

**Your first step toward large-scale usage!** üåç

## The 6-Level User Framework

```
Level 1: Curious People        ‚Üí I want to play
Level 2: Players              ‚Üí I know how to play  
Level 3: Scouts               ‚Üí I know when, why, with whom to use this
Level 4: Co-facilitators      ‚Üí We can facilitate this game!
Level 5: Lead facilitators    ‚Üí We can facilitate this game!
Level 6: Creators             ‚Üí I can imagine how to adapt this game
```

## Impact and Results

In the OpenSeriousGame ecosystem, systematic application of this template has enabled (on most documented games):
- **99 serious games** documented and made transmissible
- **100,000+ learners** reached
- **20+ cities** with active communities
- **Autonomous transmission** over 7+ years

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Choose an existing workshop** you facilitate regularly
2. **Fill the template** level by level
3. **Test with users** from each level
4. **Iterate** based on feedback
5. **Share** in the community

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Underestimating level 3:** Scouts need context
- **Neglecting variants:** Adaptability ensures transmission
- **Incomplete documentation:** Each level must be self-sustaining
- **Forgetting licenses:** Clarify usage and modification terms

## The Broader Vision

OpenSeriousTemplate V3 demonstrates that a systematic framework can transform individual creations into durable collective resources. By intentionally structuring transmission, we enable each creator to contribute to a learning ecosystem that exceeds the sum of its parts.

**The goal isn't just to create good games, but to create a system that continuously generates better games and better transmitters.**

This framework embodies the core philosophy of viral knowledge transmission: **every participant becomes both beneficiary and transmitter**, creating self-sustaining chains of knowledge sharing and personal development.

## Call to Action

The future of learning won't be built by institutions alone‚Äîit will emerge from networks of passionate individuals who think systemically and design for transmission.

**Questions for your context:**
- What workshop or training do you facilitate that could benefit from this framework?
- How might your organization's learning content become more transmissible?
- What would happen if every valuable learning experience was designed to create more facilitators?

Start with one workshop. Apply the template. Test it. Share it. Watch it evolve beyond your original vision.
