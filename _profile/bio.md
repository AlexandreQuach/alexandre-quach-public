# Alexandre Quach - Professional biography

I am driven by a single question: **"How can we make people, computers and organizations work together way better than they do today?"**

I have dedicated my professional life to developing the next generation of collective intelligence and wisdom. Technology after technology, systems can work together in smarter ways.

## Core Philosophy

> "In the world that's coming, business leaders will be the most influential people with the power to change the world at scale. They are the best channel for transformation and knowledge diffusion."

My role is to prepare these leaders with the frameworks, insights, and capabilities they need to succeed in an increasingly complex world.

## Professional Background

**Current Role**: Founder of [Komyu](https://komyu.fr) - augmented collective intelligence consulting firm  
**Experience**: 15+ years in organizational transformation, agile coaching, and executive education  
**Specialization**: Engineering corporate collectives, breaking silos, preparing leaders for the future

### Key Career Highlights
- **Thales** (2021-present): Consultant supporting internal leaders of transversal programs across multiple business units
- **BNP Paribas** (2019-2021): Agile Coach for large-scale transformation programs (100+ people tribes)
- **GRDF** (2017-2019): Scrum Master and learning community organizer (150+ people)
- **France Télévisions** (2014-2017): Product Owner and Scrum Master for national digital products
- **Amadeus** (2010-2012): Product Manager for global travel distribution solutions (60+ countries)

## The ECC Method

I've developed the **ECC Method** (Engineering Corporate Collectives) - a systematic approach to breaking organizational silos and unlocking collective potential. This structured reasoning pipeline helps organizations diagnose and eliminate invisible barriers that prevent effective collaboration, using parametric description of situations for decision-making and non-linear resource problem-solving.

## Continuous Learning Strategy

**Current Portfolio**: 20+ certifications  
**Investment**: Significant ongoing commitment to learning every day from selected sources  
**Philosophy**: Strategic intelligence gathering from institutions that shape tomorrow's leaders

- **MIT Sloan School of Management**: 5 Executive Certificates + 12 specialized courses
- **Stanford Online**: Professional Program in Generative AI (4 courses)
- **Harvard Online**: 3 professional development programs
- **UC Berkeley**: Happiness and well-being specialization
- **Daniel Goleman Institute**: Emotional intelligence certification

### Academic Foundation
- **ENSTA ParisTech** (2009): Engineering degree in Information Systems and Production
- **Sorbonne Paris I** (2009): Master in Organizational Consulting, Business Strategy and Information Systems

## The Komyu Vision

Through my company Komyu, I've developed a systematic approach to collective intelligence enhancement:

### Four Generations of Innovation
1. **Foundation Workshops & Serious Games** (2022): Live facilitation and knowledge transfer systems
2. **Operational Frameworks** (2023): Templates for community management within constraints
3. **Strategic Diagnosis** (2024): ECC Method for organizational transformation
4. **AI-Enhanced Intelligence** (2025-): Human-AI collaboration systems

## OpenSeriousGame Movement

I founded OpenSeriousGame, a public movement to awaken the power of transmission through serious games. This viral-by-design approach enables anyone to facilitate workshops and transfer knowledge effectively.

## Engineering Mindset

I am an **engineer at heart**, which shapes my approach to complex challenges. Rather than jumping blindly into immediate problems, I prefer to **design systems that understand and solve problems at scale**. This systematic thinking is reflected in my appreciation for games like Factorio, where optimization and indirect problem-solving create exponential improvements.

My preference is for **indirect intervention**: conceiving the framework that enables others to succeed, rather than being the bottleneck solution. However, I naturally adapt to direct problem-solving when necessity demands it.

I practice what I teach through systematic approaches:

- **Knowledge Graph Learning**: Connecting insights across domains for deeper understanding
- **Compound Thinking**: Building skills that amplify each other (Factorio-style development)
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding patterns and relationships rather than isolated events
- **Continuous Learning**: Daily commitment to professional development as necessity, not luxury

### Martial Arts & Philosophy (15+ years)
- **Wing Tsun** (7 years): Precision, efficiency, and systematic skill development
- **Modern Tahtib** (4 years): Strategic distance and flow management
- **Shaolin Kung Fu** (4 years): Internal energy cultivation and discipline
- **Philosophical Foundations**: Stoicism (Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus), Taoism (Tao Te Ching), strategic thinking (The Art of War - read regularly since high school)

### Personal Interests
- **Healthy Cooking**: Optimizing nutrition for long-term health and performance
- **Efficiency Hacking**: Discovering methods to work more effectively while preserving longevity
- **Quantum Computing**: Currently learning quantum computing principles and applications

## Why This Approach Works

### For Organizations
- **Silo elimination**: Frameworks that break down barriers limiting collective potential
- **Future readiness**: Continuous learning ensures recommendations stay ahead of evolution
- **Trusted advisor status**: Shared elite education experiences create peer-level credibility
- **Systemic solutions**: Focus on root causes rather than symptoms

### For Leaders
- **Preparation without pressure**: Learn alongside executives without competing for positions
- **Global perspective**: Insights from diverse institutions and international networks
- **Practical frameworks**: Tested methodologies that work in real organizational contexts
- **Continuous support**: Ongoing learning ensures advice remains current and relevant

## Recognition and Impact

**100+ Client Recommendations** spanning multiple industries and countries, consistently highlighting:
- Ability to diagnose and solve complex organizational challenges
- Skill in facilitating transformation across silos and hierarchies
- Capacity to inspire and develop other leaders
- Innovation in creating new methodologies and frameworks

### Current Focus Areas

### Human-AI Collaboration
Designing systems where human intelligence and AI capabilities amplify each other, particularly in:
- Collective problem-solving and decision-making
- Knowledge management and organizational learning
- Strategic planning and scenario analysis

### Engineering Corporate Collectives
Helping senior leaders navigate:
- Cross-functional collaboration and silo elimination
- Change management in uncertain environments
- Building learning cultures that adapt continuously
- Parametric analysis of organizational situations

## Future Vision

I envision a world where:
- **Organizations operate as superminds**: Collective intelligence exceeds individual capabilities
- **Learning is continuous and systemic**: 8 hours/week professional development becomes standard
- **Silos become bridges**: Organizational boundaries enhance rather than limit collaboration
- **Human-AI teams**: Technology amplifies rather than replaces human wisdom
