# Change Community Cycle: The Serious Game That Started Everything

## The Genesis of a Framework

Two days before I developed the [Change Community Cycle Framework](https://quach.fr/frameworks/2022-06-08-change-community-cycle-framework/), I was invited by **François-Xavier Lainé** to facilitate an **OpenSeriousGame session at eXalt**. What emerged from that collaborative exploration became the foundation for everything that followed - the workshops, the reference guides, and a complete methodology for community-driven transformation.

This is the story of that original game, designed as a **playful systems thinking approach** to help facilitators, change agents, and community members explore the dynamics of running change-oriented communities in organizational contexts.

> *"In a world of silos and inertia, communities open the door to collective momentum."*

## 🔄 Round Structure and Flow

### The Four-Minute Planning Cycle

Each round follows this structured process:

1. **🎭 Context Reading** (2 minutes)
   - Facilitator narrates dynamic organizational situation
   - Teams absorb new environmental factors affecting their community

2. **✍️ Strategic Planning** (4 minutes)
   - Teams develop three coordinated responses:
     - **🗓️ Organize an event** (external engagement)
     - **🧱 Structure the community** (internal organization)  
     - **📣 Create and publish content** (communication and knowledge)

3. **📣 Roadmap Presentation** (3 minutes per team)
   - Teams share their quarterly action plan
   - Visual roadmapping captures decision evolution

4. **🔁 Peer Feedback Exchange** (2 minutes)
   - Each team provides one-sentence written feedback to others
   - Focus on constructive insights rather than critique

5. **🧠 Optional Scoring** (1 minute)
   - Teams receive one point per distinct piece of feedback
   - Encourages creativity and thoughtful peer engagement

### The Power of Constraints

The four-minute time limit forces prioritization and prevents overthinking, mimicking real organizational decision-making pressures. Teams must collaborate rapidly, building alignment through shared creation rather than extended discussion.

## 🎭 Sample Round Illustration

### **Round 3: 🧪 Initiation Phase**

**Facilitator Context:**
> "Your sponsor just approved a small budget for experimentation. However, you only have active support from two departments out of five, and one enthusiastic member is pushing to 'try something concrete immediately.' Meanwhile, three other transformation initiatives launched this quarter, creating some competition for attention and resources."

**Team "Scooter Revolution" Actions:**

| **Action Type** | **Specific Response** | **Strategic Reasoning** |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **🗓️ Event** | Host co-creation pilot workshop with the two engaged departments | Build momentum with supporters before expanding |
| **🧱 Structure** | Assign two rotating experimentation leads | Distribute leadership while maintaining focus |
| **📣 Content** | Create teaser video: "Change starts small, dreams big" | Generate interest from uninvolved departments |

**Peer Feedback Received:**
> "Smart to start with supporters! Consider inviting skeptics as observers to build bridges early."

**Learning Captured:**
The team discovered the tension between moving fast enough to maintain enthusiasm while building sufficient foundation for sustainable growth - a core challenge in real community development.

- **Emphasize improvisation** to energize and surprise participants
- **Value story-building** over execution realism - focus on learning, not feasibility
- **Create progressive complexity** that mirrors real transformation challenges
- **Include unexpected elements** that test community resilience and adaptability

**Facilitator Mindset:**
- Avoid judging action feasibility - the goal is exploration and reflection
- Encourage creative problem-solving over "correct" answers
- Model systems thinking by connecting actions across rounds
- Maintain energy through enthusiastic context delivery

### During-Game Navigation

**Pacing Strategies:**
- Run fewer rounds with quality over speed if time constraints emerge
- Allow teams to build on each other's ideas across presentations
- Use feedback patterns to identify emerging insights for debrief discussion
- Adjust context complexity based on team engagement and energy levels

**Intervention Techniques:**
- If teams struggle, provide process coaching rather than content solutions
- Highlight interesting pattern differences between teams without declaring winners
- Use peer feedback to surface insights teams might miss about their own approaches
- Bridge individual team experiences to broader transformation principles

### Post-Game Integration

**Debrief Focus Questions:**
- "What community dynamics surprised you during the simulation?"
- "Which of your planned actions would you actually implement in your real context?"
- "How did external context changes affect your community strategy?"
- "What tensions between individual and collective needs did you navigate?"

**Learning Consolidation:**
- Connect game experiences to participants' actual organizational challenges
- Identify transferable principles rather than specific tactical actions
- Explore how different phases required different leadership and member behaviors
