# Change Community Cycle Framework: A Systems Approach to Community-Driven Organizational Transformation

## The Problem Communities Solve

Organizations pursuing large-scale change face a fundamental challenge: **traditional structures (departments, teams, services) create silos that resist transformation**. Change initiatives often fail because they lack the flexibility, cross-functionality, and bottom-up expression needed for sustainable adoption.

Communities offer a complementary organizational form that addresses these limitations through:

- **Flexibility**: Starting without rigid role constraints
- **Cross-functionality**: Addressing side effects and change boundaries  
- **Bottom-up expression**: Accessing informal and unofficial spaces (with appropriate safeguards)

## Framework Overview: The 7-Phase Change Community Cycle

The Change Community Cycle provides a systematic approach to aligning community activities with organizational change stages. Unlike traditional change models (ADKAR, Kotter), this framework focuses specifically on **community dynamics and activities** rather than overall organizational transformation phases.

```
INSPIRATION ‚Üí COLLECTION ‚Üí INITIATION ‚Üí REALITY CHECK ‚Üí 
SUCCESS CONFIRMATION ‚Üí EXPOSITION ‚Üí FORTIFICATION
```

## Core Framework Principles

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Community-first approach**: Change happens through people, not processes
- **Dynamic activity alignment**: Match community actions to change readiness
- **Voluntary participation**: Build on intrinsic motivation rather than mandate
- **Iterative cycles**: Balance member appropriation capacity with advancement needs

### **Key Assumptions**
- Communities work best supporting **specific changes** rather than "change in general"
- Focus on **practical changes** that can be discovered progressively
- Members view the change as **positive** (framework doesn't cover all change types)
- **No fixed timeline** - cycles adjust to balance appropriation and progress needs

## Detailed Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: INSPIRATION
*"Nobody knows what the change subject even is. Hard to generate interest."*

#### **Community Dynamics**
- **Member State**: Curious but uncommitted
- **Time Investment**: Personal time (breaks, lunch, after hours)
- **Departure Wave**: People who never asked to be members leave

#### **Internal Actions** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Share inspiring external examples (distant, highly positive applications)
- [ ] Present temporal content (forecasting, trends, future vision)  
- [ ] Create narrative introductions using fictional, simplified frameworks
- [ ] Deploy Serious Games (most relevant at this phase vs. later ones)
- [ ] Focus on differentiation from daily routine to create urgency sense

#### **External Actions** üåê
- [ ] Collaborate with other communities to raise awareness without recreating everything
- [ ] Connect with passionate sponsors/decision-makers who share convictions
- [ ] Build relationships with future key contacts for later phases

### Phase 2: COLLECTION  
*"Vague understanding emerges, mixed with apprehension and hope."*

#### **Community Dynamics**
- **Member State**: Seeking relevance to their local context
- **Time Investment**: Still personal, but professional impact enables some official time
- **Departure Wave**: People motivated only by personal curiosity leave

#### **Internal Actions** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Conduct "What's In It For Me?" workshops projecting individual gains/losses
- [ ] Facilitate SWOT analysis sessions for collective subject consideration
- [ ] Run Design Thinking workshops (especially Empathize and Ideate phases)
- [ ] Model current use cases with Value Stream Mapping
- [ ] Build team knowledge through context sharing sessions

#### **External Actions** üåê
- [ ] Seek new sponsors identified through SWOT analysis
- [ ] Connect with communities having clear common interests
- [ ] Deploy "detective" ambassadors to gather information and key contexts

### Phase 3: INITIATION
*"Clearer vision of results, but minimal practical application."*

#### **Community Dynamics**
- **Member State**: Eager to act but facing time constraints
- **Time Investment**: Still personal time vs. growing professional needs
- **Departure Wave**: People who find community activities too disadvantageous vs. time required

#### **Internal Actions** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Create and maintain FAQ resources
- [ ] Share beginner-friendly tutorials for group discovery
- [ ] Facilitate Q&A sessions for practical application

#### **External Actions** üåê
- [ ] Engage in "lobbying" and promotional comparison arguments
- [ ] Defend interests and argue for priority elevation
- [ ] Seek synergies with other communities to reduce diplomatic conflicts

### Phase 4: REALITY CHECK
*"First practical idea of what change means. Discovering resistances, obstacles to overcome."*

#### **Community Dynamics**
- **Member State**: Disillusionment as gap between expectations and reality becomes apparent
- **Time Investment**: Professional for practice, personal for absorbing shock/compensation
- **Departure Wave**: "Not worth crossing all this now, I'll wait until it becomes mandatory"

#### **Internal Actions** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Offer advanced dojos beyond basics for real-world application
- [ ] Organize peer review sessions between members
- [ ] Create mutual support groups, intervision, co-development sessions

- [ ] Rely on sponsor protection during this "desert crossing"

### Phase 5: SUCCESS CONFIRMATION
*"Recent successes need sustaining and building upon."*

#### **Community Dynamics**
- **Member State**: Growing confidence but potential complacency
- **Time Investment**: Community participation becomes habitual
- **Departure Wave**: "It's finished, nothing more to see or discover"

#### **Internal Actions** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Close or officially abandon lowest-value activities
- [ ] Establish local usage rules and standards  
- [ ] Co-create learning pathways related to the subject

## Connection to Broader OpenSeriousGame Methodology

The Change Community Cycle Framework exemplifies core OpenSeriousGame principles:

**Viral Transmission**: Each community member becomes capable of transmitting change knowledge

**Systematic Scalability**: Framework enables multiple communities across organizations

**Gamified Learning**: Serious Games integration particularly effective in Inspiration phase

**Community-Driven Evolution**: Framework itself evolves through practitioner feedback

## Success Indicators and Expected Outcomes

### **Individual Level**
- **Skill Development**: Members progress through OpenSeriousGame role levels
- **Confidence Building**: Increased willingness to experiment and teach others
- **Network Expansion**: Stronger connections across organizational boundaries

### **Community Level**  
- **Self-Organization**: Reduced dependence on external facilitation
- **Ambassador Emergence**: Community members become change advocates
- **Knowledge Production**: Original content and practices creation

### **Organizational Level**
- **Adoption Acceleration**: Faster change uptake than traditional approaches
- **Cultural Shift**: Increased openness to community-driven initiatives
- **Capability Building**: Enhanced organizational learning and adaptation capacity

## Evolution and Adaptation

This framework is designed for continuous evolution based on practitioner experience. Like all OpenSeriousGame methodologies, it uses empirical and heuristic approaches, intended to evolve through:

- **Phase Description Refinement**: Based on observed community patterns
- **Activity Correspondence Adjustment**: Matching actions to phase realities
- **Context Adaptation**: Modifications for different organizational cultures
- **Scale Considerations**: Adjustments for various community sizes and complexities

## Call to Action

The Change Community Cycle Framework demonstrates that systematic community support can dramatically improve organizational transformation success rates. By aligning community activities with change readiness phases, organizations can harness the collective intelligence and voluntary engagement that traditional change approaches often struggle to achieve.

**Questions for your context:**
- What specific change in your organization could benefit from community support?
- Which phase would your current change communities be in?
- How might systematic community development accelerate your transformation goals?

Start with one change subject. Identify the current phase. Select appropriate activities. Build your community of practice. Watch organic transmission emerge.
