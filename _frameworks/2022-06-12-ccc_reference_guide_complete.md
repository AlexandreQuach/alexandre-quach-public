|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **💡 Inspiration Activities** | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "We already know this exists" | ☐ "We've moved past just talking" | ☐ "We need solutions, not problems" | ☐ "We've proven this works already" | ☐ "We should be teaching, not learning" | ☐ "This is integrated, why revisit?" |
| **🔍 Collection Activities** | ☐ "This is too detailed for us" | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "We need practice, not research" | ☐ "We know theory, need help with problems" | ☐ "We've done this research already" | ☐ "We should share knowledge, not gather" | ☐ "This information gathering is redundant" |
| **🧪 Initiation Activities** | ☐ "This is too advanced, we're not ready" | ☐ "We should understand more first" | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "We've tried this, need advanced help" | ☐ "We've mastered the basics already" | ☐ "We should mentor others doing this" | ☐ "This is below our operational level" |
| **⚠️ Reality Check Activities** | ☐ "This assumes too much experience" | ☐ "We haven't started implementing yet" | ☐ "We're not ready for complex problems" | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "We've solved these problems already" | ☐ "We should help others with challenges" | ☐ "These aren't our current concerns" |
| **🏆 Success Confirmation Activities** | ☐ "We haven't achieved anything yet" | ☐ "We don't have results to optimize" | ☐ "We haven't succeeded at basics yet" | ☐ "We're still solving fundamental issues" | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "We should scale this, not confirm it" | ☐ "This is already confirmed and integrated" |
| **📢 Exposition Activities** | ☐ "We don't have expertise to share" | ☐ "We're still learning, not teaching" | ☐ "We're not ready to lead others" | ☐ "We need to solve our problems first" | ☐ "We should consolidate success first" | ✅ *Perfect Match* | ☐ "External focus distracts from operations" |
| **🏛️ Fortification Activities** | ☐ "This assumes we've transformed" | ☐ "We haven't even started implementing" | ☐ "We're far from operational integration" | ☐ "We're still experimenting, not operationalizing" | ☐ "We need to prove value before integration" | ☐ "We should expand before embedding" | ✅ *Perfect Match* |

### 🎯 How to Use the Mismatch Matrix

**During Activities:**
- [ ] 👂 Listen for these specific phrases and reactions from participants
- [ ] ✅ Check corresponding boxes when you hear these responses  
- [ ] 📝 Note which members express which concerns

**After Activities:**
- [ ] 📊 Count total mismatches per activity type
- [ ] 🔍 Identify patterns in member reactions
- [ ] 🎯 Adjust future activity selection based on mismatch frequency

**Resolution Strategies:**
- [ ] **🚨 High Mismatch**: Redesign activity or change target audience
- [ ] **⚠️ Moderate Mismatch**: Provide alternative tracks within same activity  
- [ ] **✅ Low Mismatch**: Continue with minor adjustments for outliers
