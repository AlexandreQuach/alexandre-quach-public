## About

I specialize in **preparing executives and transversal leaders for the AI-augmented future**. I create methods and AI agents that transform corporate decision-making, helping organizations evolve into **human-AI superminds** capable of exponential collective intelligence.

### Core Focus
- **Executive AI Preparation**: Training leaders to orchestrate human-AI collaboration systems
- **Supermind Engineering**: Designing organizations where humans and AI agents work as unified intelligent systems
- **Agentic Decision Support**: Creating AI agents that augment executive decision-making processes
- **Transversal AI Leadership**: Developing cross-functional leaders capable of breaking silos through AI-enhanced methods

### My Unique Approach
**"The Executive Preparator Who Learns With Leaders"**

While others become executives, I prepare them. I continuously learn from world-class institutions (MIT AI Strategy, Stanford AI, Harvard Leadership) not to climb the corporate ladder, but to stay ahead of the AI transformation curve and equip tomorrow's leaders with cutting-edge human-AI collaboration methodologies.
