## Practical Case Study: "Digital Customer Experience Transformation at TechnoRetail"

**Context**: TechnoRetail is a mid-sized retail company transforming their customer experience through digital initiatives. The community of 15 members includes customer service, IT, marketing, and operations teams working on multiple transformation subjects with different target maturity levels.

**Key Transformation Subjects**:
- **Data Analytics** (Target: Fortification - integrate into daily operations)  
- **Customer Journey Mapping** (Target: Exposition - share expertise with other divisions)
- **Digital Feedback Systems** (Target: Success Confirmation - prove value before expansion)
- **AI Customer Support** (Target: Reality Check - validate feasibility)
- **Omnichannel Integration** (Target: Collection - understand current state)

This integrated case study demonstrates how all 6 workshops work together to support systematic community development.

---

# Workshop 1: CCC-Goals - Community Objective Alignment

## ðŸ“– Story Example

The TechnoRetail digital customer experience community has been active for 4 months with mixed results. Members attend sessions but seem unclear about priorities. When asked "What are we trying to achieve?", different members give different answers. The VP of Customer Experience recently asked for clearer success criteria and timeline expectations.

Lisa, the community coordinator, realizes they need systematic goal alignment. Some subjects like AI support are experimental, while others like data analytics need full operational integration. The community needs to understand how far to push each subject.

## ðŸ“Š Example Result - Target Goals by Subject

| **Subject** | **Inspiration** | **Collection** | **Initiation** | **Reality Check** | **Success Confirmation** | **Exposition** | **Fortification** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Data Analytics** | | | | | | | ðŸŽ¯ Full operational integration |
| **Customer Journey Mapping** | | | | | | ðŸŽ¯ Share with other divisions | |
| **Digital Feedback Systems** | | | | | ðŸŽ¯ Prove value first | | |
| **AI Customer Support** | | | | ðŸŽ¯ Validate feasibility | | | |
| **Omnichannel Integration** | | ðŸŽ¯ Understand state | | | | | |

**Community Type Analysis**: **Multi-Target Transformation Community** - Goals span all phases, indicating diverse transformation ambitions requiring phase-specific strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.

**Strategic Insight**: This distribution shows a realistic transformation portfolio - foundational subjects (Data Analytics) target full integration while experimental subjects (AI Support) focus on feasibility validation.

## Workshop Structure

**Duration**: 30 minutes | **Participants**: 3-12 community members

### Content for Curious People

**The Challenge**: Change communities often operate with vague or misaligned objectives, leading to scattered efforts and unclear success criteria. Members invest time without understanding how their contributions connect to broader transformation goals.

**The Solution**: Systematic alignment process that maps each transformation subject to its appropriate target CCC phase based on organizational priorities, resource constraints, and strategic importance.

### Content for Participants

**Game Rules**:
1. **Subject Identification** (5 min): List all transformation subjects the community works on
2. **Target Phase Mapping** (15 min): For each subject, determine the appropriate target CCC phase based on strategic importance and constraints
3. **Priority Validation** (10 min): Confirm targets align with organizational strategy and resource reality

**Required Materials**:
- Subject identification worksheets
- CCC phase reference guide with target selection criteria
- Strategic priority matrix (organizational importance vs. resource availability)
- Target mapping grid (8 columns: Subject + 7 CCC phases)

### Content for Scouts

**Learning Objectives**: Strategic alignment, realistic target setting, resource-appropriate planning, portfolio management

**When to Use**: Community formation, strategic planning cycles, when priorities become unclear, during resource allocation decisions

### Content for Facilitators

**Facilitation Tips**:
- Start with comprehensive subject identification before target setting
- Use strategic criteria (importance, resources, timeline) for target selection
- Challenge unrealistic targets that exceed available resources
- Ensure targets reflect genuine organizational priorities, not wishful thinking

**Target Selection Criteria**:
- **Inspiration**: Awareness and interest building only

# Workshop 2: CCC-Flow - Subject Area Maturity Assessment

## ðŸ“– Story Example

Three months later, the TechnoRetail community needs to assess current progress. Lisa notices uneven advancement - some subjects seem ahead of schedule while others lag behind. Before planning next quarter's activities, they need clear understanding of where each subject actually stands versus where they want it to go.

The team has been working on all five subjects but hasn't systematically assessed current maturity levels. Lisa suspects some subjects are further along than initially thought, while others face unexpected barriers.

## ðŸ“Š Example Result - Current Status by Subject

| **Subject** | **Inspiration** | **Collection** | **Initiation** | **Reality Check** | **Success Confirmation** | **Exposition** | **Fortification** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Data Analytics** | | | | âœ… Currently here | | | |
| **Customer Journey Mapping** | | | âœ… Currently here | | | | |
| **Digital Feedback Systems** | | âœ… Currently here | | | | | |
| **AI Customer Support** | âœ… Currently here | | | | | | |
| **Omnichannel Integration** | âœ… Currently here | | | | | | |

**Maturity Analysis**: Most subjects are in early phases (Inspiration to Reality Check), showing this is an **Emerging Transformation Community** that needs foundation-building activities rather than advanced scaling work.

**Gap Analysis**: Comparing current status to target goals reveals significant advancement needed across all subjects, suggesting a 12-18 month transformation timeline.

## Workshop Structure

**Duration**: 30 minutes | **Participants**: 3-8 subject experts

### Content for Curious People

**Title**: CCC-Flow Workshop  
**Catchline**: Map the current maturity level of each transformation subject systematically
