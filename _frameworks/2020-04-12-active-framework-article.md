# The ACTIVE Framework: A Checklist for Building Healthy Learning Communities

*Developed in April 2020 within the OpenSeriousGame ecosystem - republished from my pre-AI era work*

## A Simple Tool for Complex Communities

Learning communities are living systems‚Äîdynamic, evolving, and sometimes unpredictable. While their complexity can make them powerful engines of collective growth, it also makes them challenging to assess and guide. How do you know if your community is healthy? How do you identify what needs attention without getting lost in endless analysis?

The **ACTIVE Framework** emerged from practical experience building learning communities within the OpenSeriousGame movement. It offers a simple, memorable checklist for community health that anyone can apply‚Äîwhether you're launching a new community, troubleshooting an existing one, or planning strategic improvements.

## What Makes ACTIVE Different

Unlike comprehensive community assessment tools that require extensive training or complex methodologies, ACTIVE is designed for **practical, immediate use**. It's:

- **Mnemonic**: Easy to remember and apply
- **Lightweight**: Doesn't require specialized expertise
- **Values-based**: Focuses on essential principles rather than metrics
- **Action-oriented**: Directly translates to improvement opportunities
- **Universal**: Applies across different types of learning communities

## The Six Dimensions of ACTIVE

```
üß† A - Actors of your own learning
ü§ù C - Community  
üîÅ T - Transmission
ü´Ç I - Inclusion
üíé V - Virtue
üåü E - Exemplarity
```

Each letter represents an essential dimension of community health that can be independently assessed and strengthened.

### üß† A ‚Äî Actors of Your Own Learning (Apprenants)

**Core Principle**: Everyone in the community is an active learner‚Äîconstantly growing knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes through reflection and practice.

**What This Means:**
Learning communities thrive when members take ownership of their development rather than passively consuming content. This isn't about formal education‚Äîit's about cultivating **learning mindset** and **reflective practice**.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Are members actively reflecting on their experiences and seeking improvement?
- [ ] Do people share learning insights and challenges openly?
- [ ] Are events structured to support feedback and iteration?
- [ ] Is there evidence of behavior change and skill development?
- [ ] Do members help each other learn rather than just teaching?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- Members primarily consume content without contributing insights
- Little evidence of applied learning or behavior change
- Feedback is rare or superficial
- Same people always teaching, others always receiving

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Embed reflection and debrief sessions in every community gathering
- [ ] Create peer learning partnerships or study groups
- [ ] Update learning resources based on participant feedback and insights
- [ ] Celebrate learning stories and growth examples
- [ ] Encourage "learning experiments" between sessions

**Success Indicators:**
- Members regularly share "what I learned" and "what I'm trying next"
- Content evolves based on community experience and feedback
- People seek out learning opportunities beyond formal events
- Peer mentoring and knowledge sharing happens naturally

### ü§ù C ‚Äî Community (Communaut√©)

**Core Principle**: True community emerges from shared intent, mutual support, and collective contribution‚Äînot just similarity or proximity.

**What This Means:**
Community is more than a group of people with common interests. It's a **living system** where members feel belonging, share purpose, and actively contribute to collective success.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Is there a genuine sense of belonging and shared purpose?
- [ ] Do people collaborate on projects or initiatives together?
- [ ] Are community values clear and actively practiced?
- [ ] Do members support each other beyond formal learning events?
- [ ] Is there evidence of community identity and culture?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- High participation in events but little interaction between them
- Members don't know each other's names, roles, or interests
- No shared projects or collaborative initiatives
- People leave without saying goodbye or explaining why

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Facilitate peer connection activities and relationship building
- [ ] Create collaborative projects that require multiple members
- [ ] Clarify and communicate shared values and collective goals
- [ ] Establish community rituals, traditions, or celebrations
- [ ] Enable informal communication and relationship building

**Success Indicators:**
- Members spontaneously help and support each other
- Collaborative projects emerge from community initiative
- Strong community identity and culture is evident
- People stay connected and engaged over time

### üîÅ T ‚Äî Transmission (Transmission)

**Core Principle**: Effective transmission means equipping others to act and share knowledge‚Äînot just broadcasting information.

**What This Means:**
In healthy learning communities, knowledge doesn't just flow from experts to learners. It becomes **viral**‚Äîspreading peer-to-peer as each person becomes capable of teaching others what they've learned.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Are members passing knowledge forward to others?
- [ ] Is content designed for replication and reuse by community members?
- [ ] Do people feel qualified and motivated to share what they know?
- [ ] Are there clear pathways from learning to teaching?
- [ ] Is knowledge spreading beyond the original community boundaries?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- Knowledge stays with original creators or experts
- Content requires specific expertise that community members don't develop
- Members feel unqualified to share or teach others
- No evidence of peer-to-peer knowledge transfer

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Create transmission-friendly formats (guides, games, templates)
- [ ] Invite every participant to "pass it forward" after learning something
- [ ] Develop co-facilitation and peer teaching opportunities
- [ ] Document and share successful transmission stories
- [ ] Design content specifically for peer delivery

**Success Indicators:**
- Community members regularly facilitate sessions for others
- Content spreads to other communities or contexts
- People feel confident sharing their knowledge and experience
- Peer-to-peer teaching becomes normal and celebrated

### ü´Ç I ‚Äî Inclusion (Inclusion)

**Core Principle**: Inclusion ensures everyone can bring their whole self‚Äîtheir talents, ideas, and energy‚Äîto contribute meaningfully to the community.

**What This Means:**
Inclusive communities create **multiple pathways for participation** and actively work to remove barriers that prevent people from contributing their best. This goes beyond diversity to focus on **belonging and contribution**.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Are there meaningful pathways for newcomers to join and contribute?
- [ ] Do different types of people find ways to add value?
- [ ] Is the community avoiding knowledge silos or exclusivity?
- [ ] Are communication styles and formats accessible to different preferences?
- [ ] Do people feel safe to be authentic and share vulnerabilities?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- Same types of people always participating or leading
- Newcomers struggle to find their place or contribution
- Exclusive language, inside jokes, or cultural barriers
- Limited formats or styles for participation

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Use inclusive language and create open invitations
- [ ] Map accessibility barriers and contributor diversity
- [ ] Create multiple formats for participation (verbal, written, visual, hands-on)
- [ ] Establish mentorship or buddy systems for newcomers
- [ ] Regularly assess and address participation barriers

**Success Indicators:**
- Diverse types of people participate and contribute regularly
- Newcomers quickly find meaningful ways to add value
- Multiple communication styles and participation formats are available
- People feel comfortable being authentic and vulnerable

### üíé V ‚Äî Virtue (Vertu)

**Core Principle**: Every community activity should aim for positive outcome and measurable impact, even in small ways.

**What This Means:**
Virtue isn't about moral perfection‚Äîit's about **intentional positive impact**. Healthy communities are clear about the good they're trying to create and honest about measuring their progress.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Are community objectives explicit and clearly communicated?
- [ ] Do members understand the impact they're trying to create?
- [ ] Is there evidence of positive outcomes for individuals and organizations?
- [ ] Are success stories documented and shared?
- [ ] Do activities align with stated values and purposes?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- Unclear or constantly changing objectives
- No measurement or documentation of impact
- Activities feel disconnected from stated purpose
- Members can't articulate why the community matters

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Define clear impact metrics for community activities
- [ ] Document and share success stories regularly
- [ ] Align all activities with explicit community values and objectives
- [ ] Create feedback loops to measure and improve impact
- [ ] Celebrate positive outcomes and learning from failures

**Success Indicators:**
- Clear connection between activities and intended outcomes
- Regular evidence of positive impact on members and organizations
- Strong alignment between values, activities, and results
- Continuous improvement based on impact measurement

### üåü E ‚Äî Exemplarity (Exemplarit√©)

**Core Principle**: Model the change you want to see and facilitate others becoming models themselves.

**What This Means:**
Exemplarity isn't about perfection‚Äîit's about **walking the talk** and helping others do the same. Healthy communities create leadership development pipelines where today's learners become tomorrow's examples.

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Are community leaders and facilitators accessible examples of growth?
- [ ] Do leaders invite and support others to step into leadership roles?
- [ ] Is there evidence of leadership development and succession?
- [ ] Do people feel inspired by community examples without feeling intimidated?
- [ ] Are there multiple types of leadership and contribution models?

**Common Warning Signs:**
- Leadership concentrated in few people who don't develop others
- No clear pathway for members to take on leadership roles
- Examples feel unattainable or disconnected from member reality
- Leadership burn-out without succession planning

**Pilot Actions to Strengthen:**
- [ ] Rotate facilitation roles and leadership opportunities
- [ ] Include "next steps" calls to action in every community gathering
- [ ] Create mentorship relationships between experienced and emerging leaders
- [ ] Document and share leadership development stories
- [ ] Establish multiple types of leadership and contribution roles

**Success Indicators:**
- Regular rotation of leadership and facilitation roles
- Clear pathway for leadership development and advancement
- Multiple examples of different leadership styles and approaches
- Sustainable leadership pipeline that prevents burn-out

## Using ACTIVE in Practice

### Community Health Assessment

**Process:**
1. **Individual Assessment**: Each dimension rated 1-5 with specific evidence
2. **Group Discussion**: Compare perspectives and identify patterns
3. **Priority Setting**: Choose 1-2 dimensions for focused improvement
4. **Action Planning**: Design specific interventions for selected areas

**Assessment Template:**

| Dimension | Current Rating (1-5) | Evidence/Examples | Priority for Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Actors** (Learning) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |
| **Community** (Belonging) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |
| **Transmission** (Sharing) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |
| **Inclusion** (Diversity) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |
| **Virtue** (Impact) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |
| **Exemplarity** (Leadership) | ___ | | High/Medium/Low |

### Strategic Planning Sessions

**Framework Questions:**
- Which ACTIVE dimension represents our strongest foundation?
- Which dimension, if strengthened, would have the most positive impact?
- What's one micro-action we can take this week for our priority dimension?
- How will we know if our interventions are working?

### Regular Health Check-Ins

**Monthly Community Pulse:**
- Quick survey asking members to rate each ACTIVE dimension
- Brief discussion of results and improvement opportunities
- Celebration of progress and success stories
- Identification of emerging challenges or opportunities

### Retrospective and Reflection

**After Major Events or Initiatives:**
- [ ] Which ACTIVE dimensions were strongest during this period?
- [ ] Which dimensions need more attention moving forward?
- [ ] What specific actions improved or challenged each dimension?
- [ ] How can we apply these learnings to future activities?

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Relationship to OSG Method

ACTIVE complements the OSG three-pillar framework:

| OSG Pillar | ACTIVE Dimensions | Integration Point |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Value of Transmissions** | Virtue + Actors | Impact measurement and learning outcomes |
| **Transmitting Power** | Transmission + Exemplarity | Peer teaching and leadership development |
| **Transmissible Content** | Community + Inclusion | Collaborative content creation and accessibility |

### Compatibility with Other Approaches

ACTIVE works well alongside:
- **Open Space Technology**: Use ACTIVE to assess and strengthen communities that emerge from OST events
- **Communities of Practice**: Apply ACTIVE dimensions to evaluate and develop CoP health
- **Agile/Scrum Teams**: Adapt ACTIVE for continuous improvement and team health assessment
- **Learning Organizations**: Use ACTIVE to evaluate learning culture and capability development

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge: "Too Many Things to Focus On"

**Solution**: Start with one dimension that feels most urgent or achievable. ACTIVE is designed for gradual improvement, not comprehensive overhaul.

### Challenge: "We're Already Doing All This"

**Solution**: Use ACTIVE to identify subtle improvements and blind spots. Even strong communities can benefit from systematic reflection and enhancement.

### Challenge: "Our Community is Too Small/Large for This"

**Solution**: Adapt the framework to your context. Small communities might focus on 2-3 dimensions; large communities might assess different sub-groups separately.

### Challenge: "Leadership Resistance to Assessment"

**Solution**: Start with informal use and demonstrate value through small improvements. Focus on learning and growth rather than evaluation or judgment.
