## 2025 Recommendations

### Daniel L. ‚ú® - Founder, Data.IA & Product Management | Ex-beNext
*May 27, 2025 - Alexandre worked with Daniel as client*

When we launched our reflection on gamification at ever"T, we were mainly thinking about making our processes more engaging. Then Alexandre arrived.

In a few exchanges, he turned the table (with a smile): Why gamify? For whom? What should it trigger?

It was no longer a question of fun, but of value. Of coherence. Of meaning.

With his well-tested toolkit, he helped us sort between what amuses... and what really aligns teams on what matters. All with a rare ability to adapt to the size of an organization, timing, budget, and culture.

In short: Alexandre doesn't just "advise," he transforms. I highly recommend him.

I had the pleasure of meeting Alexandre Q. during my time leading the InnerSource transversal program at Thales Group. Alexandre played a key role in helping us grow and structure our internal developer community. From the outset, it was clear that he was not only an outstanding consultant but someone with a rare ability to think and build at a systemic level.

Among all the professionals I've worked with, Alexandre stands out as the most precise and insightful. His ability to design and implement systems that model not only organizational structures but also human dynamics is nothing short of remarkable. Even in the face of corporate silos, he brings clarity, momentum, and collaboration.

What truly sets Alexandre apart is his dual mindset: both a systems architect and an entrepreneur. His frameworks are not just theoretical‚Äîthey're transformative. I was so impressed by his vision and methodology that I chose to join forces with him as a partner at Komyu. Working alongside him, I've seen firsthand how he consistently identifies hidden patterns and opportunities, helping people and organizations realize what they didn't even know they were missing.

Beyond all that ‚Äî Alexandre is simply an exceptional human being. Deeply thoughtful, generous, and grounded, he brings a rare mix of intelligence, humility, and care.

Anyone who crosses paths with Alexandre comes away changed‚Äîfor the better. His work opens minds, reshapes systems, and brings a new level of understanding to how humans can collaborate at scale.

I wholeheartedly recommend Alexandre to anyone seeking not only expertise but true transformation.

### Capucine L. - Client Project Manager
*December 22, 2024 - Capucine worked with Alexandre on the same team*

We collaborated with Alexandre for 2 years at GRDF, within the agile coaches team. Alexandre was able to challenge us by bringing his reflections, questions that encouraged us to take completely different angles. I particularly think of his way of finding how to mark minds and convey a message by taking the counterpoint with for example: what would be the worst way to give feedback? Or the worst meeting etc.

Alexandre has great intelligence and always thinks of the next move: we start small but what will be the next step and the one after? He manages to transmit his vision even if sometimes it may seem idealistic or utopian. He knows how to make it concrete through realistic steps. Finally everything becomes possible!

He knows how to bring out the best in us. He personally "coached" me and helped me trust myself to propose to my management to set up my own team on a subject that was close to my heart.

Working with Alexandre means being ready to be shaken up, to hear ideas that may seem too ambitious to us and finally realize that we are capable of achieving them.
